A Typescript version of [jkoutavas/redux-react-native-thunk](https://github.com/jkoutavas/redux-react-native-thunk). 
This "myTSReduxApp" React Native App was generated using:

```
$ react-native init myTSReduxApp --template react-native-template-typescript
$ cd myTSReduxApp
$ yarn add redux react-redux @types/react-redux redux-thunk typesafe-actions
```

TypeScript static typing is then applied based on the guidelines at [react-redux-typescript-guide](https://github.com/piotrwitek/react-redux-typescript-guide)
